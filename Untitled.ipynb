    "\n",
    "Python was created in 1991, and in mid 1990s and early 2000s,\n",
    "research institutions started replacing some parts of the compiled code with Python.\n",
    "Initially Python was used as a glue language to start and coordinate other programs,\n",
    "but apperance of fast numerical libraries in Python, allowed it to enter the domain of high performance computing.\n",
    "For example, Python libraries like [numarray : A New Scientific Array Package for Python](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/numarray-%3A-A-New-Scientific-Array-Package-for-Greenfield-Miller/3727b1ace9097add6657b8d836b28e4dc4d8a1a9)\n",
    "were used for operations on data from the Hubble telescope around year 2000 .\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"data science\" was almost inexistent at that time, even though it can be tracked to 1974 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#Etymology. The focus of the 2000s was on numerical simulations,\n",
    "and this resulted in creation of more numerical libraries for Python, like https://numpy.org/ or https://scipy.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early 2010s \"data science\" became an oportunity for natural science students to enter higher paid jobs,\n",
    "instead of becoming postdocs or possibly assistant professors. The popularity of Python among non-computer science\n",
    "students, and existence of early \"data science\" tools like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software) enforced the position of Python as a programming language."
